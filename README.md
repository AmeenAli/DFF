Deep Feature Factorization (DFF)
--------------------------------

**DFF** is the application of non-negative matrix faxtorization (NMF) to the ReLU feature activations of a deep neural network. In the case of CNNs trained on images, the resulting factors decompose an image batch into semenatic parts with a high degree of invariance to complex transformations.

This implementation relies on Pytorch and includes a GPU implementation of NMF with multiplicative updates (Lee and Seung, 2001).
